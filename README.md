# Oscar: A fortune teller bot for Watson Workspace
This sample application showcases a variety of capabilities and easy-to-use features with [IBM Watson Work Services[(https://workspace.ibm.com/). In particular it shows authentication with Watson Work Services, posting a message to a Work Services space and integration with a third party service.

The application is inspired by the [fortune unix program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)). When this app is added in a Watson Workspace space it is triggered by any message starting with `@oscar` and it will respond back with a witty saying.

Oscar can give a context-related saying if triggered by a non-empty message:
